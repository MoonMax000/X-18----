# GoToSocial Integration Analysis

## Frontend Features Incompatible with GoToSocial

This document identifies frontend functionalities that **cannot** be directly connected to GoToSocial's current feature set. These areas require custom backend development or engine modifications.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL INCOMPATIBILITIES (Require Engine Development)

**Our Features:**
- Pay-per-post content with pricing (`$5`, `$10`, etc.)
- Subscription-based access (`subscribers-only`)
- Author subscription pricing (`$29/month`, `$49/month`)
- Premium content tiers (`premium`, `followers-only`)
- Payment processing UI (unlock buttons, subscription modals)
- Revenue tracking and earnings widgets
- Purchased posts history
- Active subscriptions management

**GoToSocial Status:** ‚ùå **NOT SUPPORTED**
- GoToSocial has NO built-in monetization
- No concept of paid posts, subscriptions, or payments
- No payment processing integration

**Required Development:**
- Custom payment system integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Database schema for: payments, subscriptions, purchased_posts, earnings
- API endpoints for: purchase, subscribe, check_access, get_earnings
- Transaction management and payment verification
- Subscription lifecycle (create, renew, cancel, expire)
- Revenue analytics and reporting

---

### 2. **Advanced Content Gating & Access Control**

**Our Features:**

  - `pay-per-post` (one-time purchase)
  - `subscribers-only` (monthly subscription)
  - `followers-only` (must follow)
  - `premium` (highest tier)
- Hybrid access (post locked + preview text visible)
- Content unlocking UI with payment modals
- Access verification checks (`isPurchased`, `isSubscriber`, `isFollower`)

2. **Advanced Access Control** - Required for monetization to work

### **Phase 2 - High Priority (User Experience)**
4. **Widgets & Discovery** - Essential for engagement and retention
5. **Advanced Search** - Helps users find relevant content
6. **Analytics & Metrics** - Users expect to see engagement data

### **Phase 3 - Medium Priority (Enhancement)**
7. **Advanced Notifications** - Improves user control
8. **Media Features** - Better content creation tools
9. **Hover Cards** - Smoother UX

### **Phase 4 - Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)**
10. **Trading Signals Metadata** - ‚úÖ Simple GoToSocial customization (1-2 days, see GOTOSOCIAL_CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md)
11. **Drafts System** - Quality of life improvement
12. **Poll Enhancements** - Community features
13. **Code Snippets** - Already works via Markdown

## üîå INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### Option A: GoToSocial + Custom Backend (Recommended)
- Use GoToSocial for core social features (posts, follows, ActivityPub federation)
- Extend GoToSocial with custom metadata for trading signals (simple customization)
- Build custom backend service for:
  - Monetization
  - Analytics
  - Recommendations
- Frontend calls both APIs

**Pros:**
- Leverage ActivityPub federation
- Keep social features standard-compliant
- Flexible monetization implementation

**Cons:**
- Complexity of dual backend
- Need to sync data between systems
- More infrastructure

### Option B: Fork GoToSocial Engine
- Fork GoToSocial
- Add custom features directly to engine
- Maintain fork separately

**Pros:**
- Single unified backend
- Tighter integration

**Cons:**
- Must merge upstream updates
- Harder to maintain
- May break ActivityPub compliance

### Option C: Build Custom Backend (No GoToSocial)
- Implement ActivityPub from scratch
- Full control over features

**Pros:**
- Complete customization
- No limitations

**Cons:**
- Massive development effort
- Hard to maintain ActivityPub compliance
- Reinventing the wheel

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this analysis** with product and engineering teams
2. **Decide on integration architecture** (A, B, or C)
3. **Prioritize missing features** based on MVP requirements
4. **Design database schema** for custom features
5. **Create API specification** for custom endpoints
6. **Plan frontend-backend integration** strategy
7. **Set up development environment** with GoToSocial + Custom service
8. **Begin Phase 1 development** (Monetization + Signals)
