## ‚úÖ Step 1: Check Modal Styling

All monetization modals have been styled with:
- **Rounded corners** (`rounded-2xl` for modals, `rounded-lg` for buttons/inputs)
- **Consistent dark theme** (bg `#0B0E13`)
- **Green widget borders** (matching app theme)
- **Gradient buttons** (purple for paid, pink for tips, blue for follow)
- **Smooth animations** (backdrop blur, hover effects)

### Where to test:

1. **Payment Modal** (For unlocking paid posts)
   - Navigate to `/feedtest` or `/profile`
   - Find a post with "Paid Content" gating
   - Click "Unlock for $X" or "Subscribe $X/mo"
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Rounded modal, gradient purple buttons, card input fields

2. **Tip Modal** (For sending donations)
   - Navigate to any profile page (e.g., `/profile`, `/profile/new`)
   - Click the "Send Donation" button in profile hero
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Rounded modal, preset amount buttons, pink gradient "Send" button

3. **Follow Modal** (For followers-only content)

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Creator Viewing Own Posts

**Issue:** Creators shouldn't be able to purchase or subscribe to their own content.

**Solution:** The `isOwnPost` prop now automatically unlocks content for creators.

### How to verify:

1. **Navigate to your own profile:**
   - Go to `/profile` (this shows @TyrianTrade's profile)
   - You should see posts by @TyrianTrade

2. **Check paid posts:**
   - Look for posts with `isPremium: true` in `/client/data/socialPosts.ts`
   - On your own profile, these posts should display **WITHOUT** the gated content block
   - ‚úÖ Verify: You can see the full content, images, and text
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "Unlock" or "Subscribe" buttons appear

3. **Check followers-only posts:**
   - Posts with `audience: "followers"` should also be visible
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "Follow [Author]" button appears

4. **On other profiles:**
   - Visit `/profile/new` or any other user's profile
   - Paid/premium posts should show the gated content block
   - ‚úÖ Verify: "Unlock" and "Subscribe" buttons are visible

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Subscription Benefits

**Feature:** When you subscribe to an author, ALL their posts (paid, premium, subscribers-only) become free.

### How to verify:

1. Navigate to `/feedtest` or a profile with paid posts
2. Find a post by a specific author with "Subscribers Only" or "Paid Content"
3. Click "Subscribe $X/mo"
4. Complete mock payment
5. ‚úÖ Verify: After success, the page reloads
6. ‚úÖ Verify: All posts by that author are now unlocked
7. ‚úÖ Verify: `isSubscriber` state is true (check with React DevTools)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Profile Widgets

### New Widgets Added:

**Mock data:** Currently shows 3 subscriptions (CryptoWhale, Market Maven, Tech Trader)

#### 2. **Purchased Posts Widget** üîê
